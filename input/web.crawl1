Mr. Goldberg grew up in Minneapolis and graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in history and government. He joined the consulting firm Bain & Company, then moved to Capitol Records as a marketer. In 1993, he and his best friend from high school started Launch Media, a digital music magazine that was initially distributed by CD-ROM.

In 2001, Yahoo bought Launch, and Mr. Goldberg became head of Yahoo Music, living in Los Angeles. Around that time, he began dating Ms. Sandberg, then an advertising executive at Google, in the Bay Area. “I lost the coin flip as to where we were going to live,” he told Business Insider in a recent interview.

In 2007, he quit Yahoo and joined Benchmark Capital as an entrepreneur in residence, where he spent a couple of years before becoming chief executive of SurveyMonkey.
